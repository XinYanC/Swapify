# Swapify

## AXiS Marketplace Project: Swapify

Frontend Vite: [swapify](swapify).
Backend Python: [AXiS](https://github.com/XinYanC/AXiS)

## Project Structure

The repository has two parts: the frontend app in [swapify](swapify) and the backend in the [AXiS repo](https://github.com/XinYanC/AXiS).

Here is how [Swapify](swapify) is structured:

- [swapify/src/app](swapify/src/app): App shell and root layout (e.g., `App.jsx`).
- [swapify/src/pages](swapify/src/pages): Page-level components routed by URL (e.g., Home, Login, Item Details).
- [swapify/src/components](swapify/src/components): Shared UI components used across pages.
- [swapify/src/api](swapify/src/api): API client helpers and endpoint wrappers.
- [swapify/src/api/tests](swapify/src/api/__tests__): Placeholder tests for API wrappers.
- [swapify/src/styles](swapify/src/styles): Global styles.
- [swapify/public](swapify/public): Static assets served by Vite.
